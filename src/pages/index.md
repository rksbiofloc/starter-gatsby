  With almost seven billion people on earth, the demand for aquatic food carries on to increase and hence, expansion and intensification of aquaculture production are highly required. The prime goal of aquaculture expansion must be to produce more aquaculture products without significantly increasing the usage of the basic natural resources of water and land. The second goal is to develop sustainable aquaculture systems that will not damage the environment. The third goal is to build up systems providing an equitable cost/benefit ratio to support economic and social sustainability. All these three prerequisites for sustainable aquaculture development can be met by biofloc technology.
