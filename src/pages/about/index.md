### Our origin
we are a family run Business, aiming to come up with inventive and cost effective ways to help farmers keep up with the current trend of technology and get the most profit using less land area.

### Sustainable farming
Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities Developing sustainable aquaculture systems that will not damage the environment is an important factor.

### Reinvest profits
We want to expand our business to more areas. We will utilize our experience and the profit from the culture to increase the farming area and significantly raise the biofloc produce. Our goal is to build up systems providing an equitable cost/benefit ratio to support economic and social sustainability

### Empower Others
We want to share our experience with others who are new to this business and help them setup their own Biofloc Culture. This will help us build a better community and empower each other in the process.
